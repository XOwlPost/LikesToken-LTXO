Potential Addition to the Security Module
The extended code with the removeModuleHookAddress function is indeed a valuable addition, particularly for a security module. Here's why:

Dynamic Module Management: It allows for more dynamic management of modules. You can add new modules, execute existing ones, and now also have the ability to remove modules. This flexibility is crucial for maintaining and updating the system as needed.

Security Enhancements: The ability to remove module hooks can be a critical security measure. If a module is compromised or no longer needed, it can be safely and effectively removed from the system.

Audit Trail: Emitting events for each action provides a clear audit trail, which is essential for security and transparency.

Implementation Timing
Initial Implementation: Initially, the core functionalities like setting and executing hooks should be implemented in the LikesToken contract. This establishes the foundation for modular architecture.

Post-Launch Extension: Once the contract is live and operational, you can introduce the removeModuleHookAddress function. This could be part of a planned upgrade or in response to evolving security needs.

Integration with Security Module: When the security module is developed, it can inherit or extend these functionalities. The security module might focus on more complex security measures while utilizing the foundational code of the core contract.
